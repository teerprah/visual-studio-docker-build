# visual-studio-docker-build

This configuration is not supported by Microsoft, but might come in handy when Build Tools alone are not sufficient for compilation during CI. Please check Windows Server container licence for mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore.

Also added 7zip, git, nuget,  nunit-console-runner using chocolatey -- all available in PATH.
